# Manifold-learning-with-Feature-types-distributed-clustering-workflow-is-more-informative-compared-to-UMAP for tabular clinical datasets
* We experimented on five clinical and bio-medical datasets to prove that Feature-types Distributed Clustering (FDC) gives more interpretable clusters than conventional UMAP evaluation measures like the Silhouette score, Dunn index, and ANOVA test.
* In FDC, high-dimensional data is reduced to the intermediate dimension and then to the final low dimension (two), where we can extract clusters from both dimensions (intermediate and low).
* FDC_intermediate_Dimension: this folder contains all necessary libraries(FDC), python code(Jupyter notebooks), and their respective datasets(CSV files) used to extract clusters from FDC intermediate-dimension.
* FDC_low_Dimension: this folder contains all necessary libraries(FDC),  python code(Jupyter notebooks), and their respective datasets(CSV files) used to extract clusters from FDC low-dimensions.
* To run any notebook, please ensure that library FDC, cluster.py and its respective data(.CSV) are on the same path.
* Both folders contain Jupyter notebooks of five datasets and their HTML versions.
* If anyone wants to apply FDC for other datasets, provide a list of continuous, ordinal, and nominal features separately for the FDC function.
* Follow the same steps as provided in Jupyter notebooks.
